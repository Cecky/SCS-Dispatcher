# SCS-Dispatcher
This is just another tool to simply create your own jobs.
I used the widely known "Virtual Speditor" for quite some time but
I wasn't happy with the ui. It was just to confusing and it's only
using the internal names of cities, cargoes an companies.
So i tried to build my own tool with a stripped down ui and
the possibility to use the localized names for cargo and cities.
